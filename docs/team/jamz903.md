### Project: UniCa$h

UniCa$h is a desktop application used for university students who want to be more financially conscious.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. 
It is written in Java, and has about 19 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
