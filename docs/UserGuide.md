##### Successful Execution

###### Example 1

>```
>**Remark**: No expenses will be removed and no changes made to file. 
> The above error is the same as the one for the simple “delete” function. 
> In the above example, the delete_all_expenses functionality is 
> intentionally obfuscated to prevent the user from accidental mass deletions. 
> The rationale is that a user unsure of a basic command like delete is probably a new user, 
> and a new user should not be directed to mass delete information. 
> There are other, more proper ways to convey this information, such as this User Guide.

Unicash is this and that ...

## 2. Index of Contents

## 3. Quick Start

### 3.1 Installation

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `unicash.jar` from [our latest release](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-T16-3/tp/releases/tag/v1.3).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your UniCa$h.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar unicash.jar` command to
   run the application.

   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will
   open the help window.<br>

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

2. `Amount` entered has to be positive for both `income` and `expense`.
3. `Amount` is automatically rounded to 2 decimal places.
4. `UniqueCategoryList` enforces a unique (case-insensitive) constraint on `Category` it stores.

> **Input**: `add_transaction`
>
> **Output**:

#### 4.1.3 EditTransactionCommand

#### 4.1.4 DeleteTransactionCommand

Deletes a `Transaction` from UniCa$h.

Command: `delete_transaction <INDEX>`

Command Word: `delete_transaction` (case-insensitive)

Command Argument: `<INDEX>` is the displayed transaction index 
of the transaction to be deleted, as shown in the `Transactions List`.

| Arguments | Optional? | Purpose                                            |
|-----------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `<INDEX>` | No        | Transaction index of the transaction to be deleted |

Important notes:
1. The `delete_transaction` command word is case-insensitive, thus `DELETE_TRANSACTION` is 
considered an equivalent command word. 

2. `<INDEX>` must be a positive integer, i.e. a number greater than 0.

3. `<INDEX>` must be equal to or smaller than 2,147,483,647 which is the `Integer.MAX_VALUE` provided by Java 11.

4. `<INDEX>` must be equal to or smaller than the largest displayed transaction index
   of all transactions as shown in the `Transactions List`. Thus, even if there are `100` total transactions but only
   `20` of those transactions are displayed in the current `Transactions List`, the maximum `INDEX` allowed
   would be `20`

5. Given `3.` and `4.`, the maximum allowed `<INDEX>` is the smaller value of the two.

##### Successful Execution

###### Example 1

> **Case**: Delete a transaction with the correctly specified `<INDEX>`.
>
> **Input**: `delete_transaction 1`
>
> **Output**:
> ```
> Deleted Transaction:
>
> Name: Evening with friends;
> Type: expense;
> Amount: $49.50;
> Date: 17 Sep 2023 00:00;
> Location: Clarke Quay;
> Categories: #social

> Input:

> Output:
> <img src="images/unicash/command-outputs/deleteTransaction/deleteTransactionSuccess1FinalState.png" width="1000" />

###### Example 2

> **Case**: Delete a transaction with the currently not visible but correctly specified `<INDEX>`.
>
> **Input**: `delete_transaction 1`
>
> **Output**:
> ```
> Deleted Transaction:
> 
> Name: Lunch at McDonalds;
> Type: expense;
> Amount: $17.40;
> Date: 15 Sep 2023 11:00;

##### Failed Execution

###### Example 1

> **Case**: Missing compulsory fields.
>
> **Input**: `delete_transaction`
>
> **Output**:
> ```
> Invalid command format! 
>
> delete_transaction: Deletes the transaction identified by the index number used in the displayed transaction list.

> Argument: Index (must be a positive integer)
>
> Example: delete_transaction 1
> ```
> <img src="images/unicash/command-outputs/deleteTransaction/deleteFail1.png" width="1000" />

###### Example 2

> **Case**: Invalid `<INDEX>` provided
> (`<INDEX>` given as `10` given when only `5` transactions are presently displayed)
>
> **Input**: `delete_transaction 10`
>
> **Output**:

> The transaction index provided is invalid
> ```
> <img src="images/unicash/command-outputs/deleteTransaction/deleteFail2.png" width="1000" />

#### 4.1.5 FindCommand

#### 4.1.6 GetCommand

Retrieves a `Transaction` from UniCa$h.

Command: `get <INDEX>`

Command Word: `get` (case-insensitive)

Command Argument: `<INDEX>` is the displayed transaction index
of the transaction to be retrieved, as shown in the `Transactions List`.

| Arguments | Optional? | Purpose                                              |
|-----------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `<INDEX>` | No        | Transaction index of the transaction to be retrieved |

Important notes:
1. The `get` command word is case-insensitive, thus `GET` is
   considered an equivalent command word.

2. `<INDEX>` must be a positive integer, i.e. a number greater than 0.

3. `<INDEX>` must be equal to or smaller than 2,147,483,647 which is the `Integer.MAX_VALUE` provided by Java 11.

4. `<INDEX>` must be equal to or smaller than the largest displayed transaction index
   of all transactions as shown in the `Transactions List`. Thus, even if there are `100` total transactions but only
   `20` of those transactions are displayed in the current `Transactions List`, the maximum `INDEX` allowed
   would be `20`

5. Given `3.` and `4.`, the maximum allowed `<INDEX>` is the smaller value of the two.
