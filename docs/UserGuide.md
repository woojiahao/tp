UniCa$h **is a desktop application used for university students who want to be more financially conscious,
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface
(GUI). If you can type fast, UniCa$h can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick Start

<div class="callout callout-important" markdown="span">
Please read through sections [Installation](#installation) and [Command Breakdown](#command-breakdown) before approaching any command documentation
</div>

### Installation

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `unicash.jar` from [GitHub](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-T16-3/tp/releases/tag/v1.3.1).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your UniCa$h.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar unicash.jar` command to
   run the application.

   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
 
   <img src="images/Ui.png" width="650">


5. Type the command in the command box and press `Enter` to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing `Enter` will
   open the help window.

   To get started with UniCa$h, you can run the `add_transactions` command!  

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

### Command Breakdown

<div class="callout callout-info" markdown="span" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
This section is important in understanding the constraints and components of a command. All constraints apply to all usages of these prefixes in the commands.
</div>

Commands in UniCa$h have the following structure:

<p style="text-align: center;">
`command_word (ARGUMENT) (PREFIXES)`
</p>

| command_word                                                                                                    | ARGUMENT                                                                                                      | PREFIXES                                                                                                               |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Represents the command to run. May be referenced by alternative shorthands as described in each command section | Comes before all prefixes and often used to reference an index within the transactions list<br>Often optional | Often referred to as "Parameters"<br>Commonly used to specify various attributes/properties for a given `command_word` |

#### Argument Types

| Argument              | Meaning                                  | Constraints                                                                                               | Remarks                                                                          |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `INDEX`<sup>1,2</sup> | Index of transaction in transaction list | Integer indices that must be `>= 1` (positive integer) and are one-indexed, i.e. start with `1`, not `0`. | Commonly used in edit and delete to reference transactions in a transaction list |

**Notes:**

1. `INDEX` uses positive integers which we define as integers that are strictly greater than `0`. 
2. UniCa$h divides the error handling for `INDEX` into two cases, non-positive integers, i.e. `<= 0` values, are treated as invalid command formats while values that exceed the transaction list will be treated as being an invalid index as the supported values are `[1, transaction list size]`.

<div class="callout callout-info" markdown="span">
For more clarity about how commands are parsed and why `INDEX` is parsed this way, please refer to our [developer guide](DeveloperGuide.html#delete-transaction) on how some commands like `delete_transaction` handles `INDEX`.
</div>

#### Prefixes

Prefixes are in the format: 

<p style="text-align: center;">
`prefix/Value`
</p>

Prefixes have several variations with different notations:

||Mandatory|Optional<sup>1</sup>|
||---------|--------|
|Not variadic|`prefix/Value`|`[prefix/Value]`|
|Variadic|`prefix/Value...`|`[prefix/Value]...`|

**Notes:**

1. Optional fields imply that the _omission_, not the absence of value when used, is supported. This means that `l/` is **_NOT_** an optional parameter, but rather a blank one.

#### Prefix Types

<div class="callout callout-info" markdown="span" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
The constraints for the prefixes used in UniCa$h are universal across all commands.
<br><br>
Note that each command might use the prefixes slightly differently so refer to each command's details for more information.
</div>

| Prefix                                                                 | Constraints                                                                                                                                           | Remarks                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Valid                                                                             | Invalid                                               |

**Notes:**

1. Amounts can be exactly `$0.00` as users may want to simply track that a transaction is present but not specify the amount.
User might also want to track financial events not involving currency exchange, such as barter trading, free gifts, etc 
2. Intervals work by filtering by the specified time period. 
   1. For `day` intervals, only transactions of the same day are found. 
   2. For `week` intervals, only transactions of the same [week of year](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/time/temporal/WeekFields.html#weekOfYear()) are found. 
   3. For `month` intervals, only transactions of the same month are found.

### UI Layout

UniCa$h is designed with users who prefer to use the keyboard in mind. Thus, almost all
user input is designed for CLI-type usage, i.e. text-based keyboard input, and UI elements are intended 
to either supplement this main functionality, or provide graphical support.

When UniCa$h is first opened, it would look something like this:

![img_1.png](images/unicash/UniCashWelcome.png)

By default, the Welcome Message will be displayed in the `Results Display`.
This message can also be invoked with the `help` command which will be explained
later on in this User Guide. Below are the main User Interface (UI) component features
we have implemented in UniCa$h.

![img_2.png](images/unicash/UniCashUIAnnotated.png)

Explained below are the main UI components. For the purposes of demonstrating certain UI features, certain commands
and inputs that are yet to be explained are mentioned here. However, at a later section of this User Guide,
all of these commands and inputs will be explained, feel free to refer to them at your discretion. _Where applicable,
consider those explanations as the single source of authority for those commands as the representation here is merely
for UI demonstration purposes only._


#### UniCa$h Main Window Components

- The Main Window in UniCa$h is resizeable, but has a minimum size enforced.
- The Menu bar contains the `File` and `Help` menus, of which `Help` can be opened with the
`F1` keyboard shortcut, which is also default to the original `AB-3`.


- _Note: On macOS, using UniCa$h in fullscreen will cause the Summary Window and Help Window to also
open in fullscreen, however this is an expected behaviour caused by macOS's window management style, and does not
cause any functional issues._ 

#### Command Box
- The `Command Box` is the primary means by which the user interacts actively with the application.
- The user types specific inputs into the `Command Box` and presses `ENTER` after typing to "communicate" with UniCa$h.
- The responses from UniCa$h for each input will be as defined in the subsection for each command in the later part of this User Guide
- Given that our application is targeted for users who prefer CLI-type text input interaction, the `Command Box`
is configured such that it can remember up to `10` latest user inputs. 
  - When a user presses `ENTER` on any input, the input is stored regardless of its validity.
  - These inputs can be traversed through with the `UP` and `DOWN` arrow keys on the keyboard.
  - Only the `10` most recent inputs are stored by the `Command Box`

  - _Note that due to a JavaFX built-in cursor control functionality (i.e. arrows keys can be used to navigate the menu bar),
  the mouse cursor being too close to the menu can occasionally trigger this functionality instead, simply move your
  mouse cursor away from the menu bar if this happens to alleviate the issue._
- At any point in time, the user can press the `ESC` to empty the current text field in the `Command Box` 

#### Transactions List
- Each transaction input by the user is displayed in the `Transactions List`. 
- The entire `Transactions List` will be displayed initially, however certain commands might limit this
listing, which can be reversed with the `list` command to show the entire list again.
- The `Transactions List` is ordered by the time at which the user inputs the transaction,
not the actual date and time associated with that particular transactions.
- Transactions added will immediately appear at the top of the `Transactions List`, and this is to
provide immediate response to the user as they will be able to see their most recently input 
transaction right away.
- The most recent transactions appear at the top of the `Transactions List`.

#### Transaction
- The `Transactions List` contains individual `Transactions` that look like this:

![img_1.png](images/unicash/TransactionCardAnnotated.png)

- **Transaction ID/Index/Number:** All terms used synonymously to refer to the number shown on the left partition of the blue box. Based
on the configuration of `Transactions List`, this number might change, and that is the intended effect, the use for which 
will be explained in the applicable commands, including `delete`, `edit` and `get` commands.
- **Transaction Name:** The name of the given transaction, shown on the right partition of the blue box.
- **Transaction Date:** The date assigned to the transaction, shown inside the pink box.
- **Transaction Location:** The location assigned to the transaction, shown inside the red box.
- **Transaction Categories:** The category/categories assigned to the transaction, shown inside the yellow box.
- **Transaction Amount:** The expense or income assigned to the transaction, shown inside the black box.
  - Expenses will be preceded with a `negative` sign and in red color, whereas incomes will not be preceded with any
  sign and displayed in green color. 
  - _This applies to the amount `0.00` as well, thus display color
is based only on transaction type`._


Note: Certain properties above (such as name, location, categories and amount)
are allowed values that exceed the UI's capacity to display them fully. For 
example, a transaction name that is too long will be shortened by the application,

![img_1.png](images/unicash/TransactionCardFull.png)

This effect is accounted for as we do not wish to limit the user to arbitrary
lengths. Thus, the `get` command is available to retrieve the full, expanded details
of these transactions and display them in the `Results Display` component.

#### Results Display

- The `Results Display` is the primary means by which UniCa$h "responds" back
to the user via text output.
- The `Results Display` can be scrolled if the text output displayed is too long.

#### Data Source Indicator

- The `Data Source Indicator` shows the location of the current UniCa$h storage file.


#### Rolling Balance Indicator

- The `Rolling Balance Indicator` shows the net sum (i.e. `total income - total expense`) 
for the **currently displayed `Transactions List`**.
- For example, if the input `find n/friends` was used to find transactions whose names 
contain the keyword `friends`, the `Transactions List` would be updated to
only show matching transactions and likewise the `Rolling Balance Indicator` 
would reflect the net sum for these transactions.
- If the currently displayed `Transactions List` is the entire list (i.e. after using 
the `list` command), then the `Rolling Balance Indicator` would show the net sum of all 
transactions in UniCa$h. 
- _Note: Unlike the color of an amount of a transaction in `Transactions List`, the color of
the `Rolling Balance Indicator` will change based on whether the net sum is positive (green)
or negative (red) or zero (black)._

Important notes:

1. While all options besides `INDEX` are optional, **you must specify at least one field** you wish to edit (
   i.e. `Name`, `Type`, `Amount`, `Datetime`, `Location`, or `Category`).
2. You must provide a non-empty value for the `Name`, `Type`, and `Amount` fields if you wish to edit them; they cannot
   be left empty.
3. The `INDEX` option must be specified first. The order in which you specify the other options does not matter.
4. Modifying a transaction's category will result in the replacement of all existing categories. 
   - For example, in the case of a `Transaction` with two existing categories (Entertainment and Hobbies), editing it with `edit INDEX c/Education` will replace all existing categories, leaving the transaction with a single category, Education."

#### Delete Transaction

Deletes a `Transaction` from UniCa$h.

Command: `delete_transaction INDEX`

Command Words Accepted: `delete_transaction`, `delete`, `del` (case-insensitive)

Command Argument: `<INDEX>` is the displayed transaction index
of the transaction to be deleted, as shown in the `Transactions List`.

| Arguments | Optional? | Purpose                                            |
|-----------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `<INDEX>` | No        | Transaction index of the transaction to be deleted |

Important notes:

1. The `delete_transaction` command word is case-insensitive, thus `DELETE_TRANSACTION` is
   considered an equivalent command word.

2. `<INDEX>` must be a positive integer, i.e. a number greater than 0.

3. `<INDEX>` must be equal to or smaller than 2,147,483,647 which is the `Integer.MAX_VALUE` provided by Java 11.

4. `<INDEX>` must be equal to or smaller than the largest displayed transaction index
   of all transactions as shown in the `Transactions List`. Thus, even if there are `100` total transactions but only
   `20` of those transactions are displayed in the current `Transactions List`, the maximum `INDEX` allowed
   would be `20`

5. Given `3.` and `4.`, the maximum allowed `<INDEX>` is the smaller value of the two.

##### Successful Execution

###### Example 1

> **Case**: Delete a transaction with the correctly specified `<INDEX>`.

#### Get Transaction

Retrieves a `Transaction` from UniCa$h.

Command: `get <INDEX>`

Command Words Accepted: `get`, `g` (case-insensitive)

Command Argument: `<INDEX>` is the displayed transaction index
of the transaction to be retrieved, as shown in the `Transactions List`.

| Arguments | Optional? | Purpose                                              |
|-----------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `<INDEX>` | No        | Transaction index of the transaction to be retrieved |

Important notes:

1. The `get` command word is case-insensitive, thus `GET` is
   considered an equivalent command word.

2. `<INDEX>` must be a positive integer, i.e. a number greater than 0.

3. `<INDEX>` must be equal to or smaller than 2,147,483,647 which is the `Integer.MAX_VALUE` provided by Java 11.

#### Find Transaction(s)

Finds a `Transaction` in UniCa$h.

Command: `find [n/NAME] [l/LOCATION] [c/CATEGORY]`

Command Words Accepted: `find`, `search`, `f` (case-insensitive)

Command Argument: `<INDEX>` is the displayed transaction index
of the transaction to be retrieved, as shown in the `Transactions List`.

Command Options:

| Option Name      | Optional?       | Purpose                                                      |
|------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| n/               | Yes*            | Search keyword for the name of a transaction.                |
| l/               | Yes*            | Search keyword for the location of a transaction.            |
| c/               | Yes*            | Search keyword for a category tagged to a transaction        |
| Any of the above | Min. one option | At least one option must be specified for the `find` command |

Important notes:
1. The `find` command word is case-insensitive, thus `FIND` is
   considered an equivalent command word.

2. *While each option is considered Optional, at least one option must be specified in total

3. All keywords specified must match in order for a transaction to be displayed.
4. Only one instance of each option can be specified, i.e. `/n Friends n/Dinner` is invalid as the name 
option is specified more than once.
5. For each keyword, a full substring match is required, thus `find n/Lunch with friends` with search for transactions
whose name contains the String `Lunch with friends` and not `Lunch`, `with`, and `friends` separately. However, an 
exact match is not required as a transaction with the name `Lunch with friends outside` contains the above substring
and therefore it will be flagged as a match.

##### Successful Execution

###### Example 1
