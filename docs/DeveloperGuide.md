## Implementation

This section aims to describe the implementation of the features in UniCash.

There are 3 main group of features we have came up with.
1. Transaction
2. Budget
3. General

### Transaction

<img src="images/unicash/TransactionClassDiagram.png" width="700" />

UniCash tracks transactions with the use of `TransactionList` and `Transaction`. `TransactionList` acts
as a wrapper for a list of `Transaction` that enforces no `null`.

#### Add Transaction

The `add_transaction` command adds a new `Transaction` to the `TransactionList` in UniCash.

The activity diagram of adding a Transaction is as shown below

<img src="images/unicash/AddTransactionActivityDiagram.png" width="700" />

The following sequence diagram shows how the different components of UniCash interact with each other
