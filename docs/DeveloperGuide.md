## Implementation

This section aims to describe the implementation of the features in UniCa$h.

There are 4 main groups of features that we have designed and either implemented
or propose to implement in the future.

These are:
1. Transaction Management Features
2. Budget Management and Monitoring Features
3. General Utility Features
4. User Interface Features

### Feature Group 1 - Transactions Management

#### The Transaction Class

<img src="images/unicash/TransactionClassDiagram.png" width="700" />

UniCa$h tracks transactions with the use of `TransactionList` and `Transaction`. `TransactionList` acts
as a wrapper for a list of `Transaction` that enforces no `null`.

The `Transaction` class is composed of the following fields

1. `Name`: The name of the transaction.
2. `Type`: The transaction type of the transaction. UniCash supports expense and income only.
3. `Amount`: The monetary value of the transaction.
4. `DateTime`: The date and time of the transaction to be recorded.
5. `Location`: The location where the transaction took place.
6. `UniqueCategoryList`: A list of categories to be tagged with the transaction.

For the attributes, there are 3 compulsory fields, namely `Name`, `Type` and
`Amount`. The remaining fields would fall back to a default value if not specified.

#### Add Transaction

##### Overview

The `add_transaction` command adds a new `Transaction` to the `TransactionList` in UniCash.

The activity diagram of adding a Transaction is as shown below

<img src="images/unicash/AddTransactionActivityDiagram.png" width="600" />

The following sequence diagram shows how the different components of UniCash interact with each other

<img src="images/unicash/AddTransactionSequenceDiagram.png" width="1400" />

The above sequence diagram omits details on the creation of the attributes of a `Transaction` such as
`Name`, `Type` and `Amount` as it would make the diagram cluttered and difficult to read without adding
additional value.

ℹ️ **Note:** The lifeline for `AddTransactionCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML,
the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

##### Details

1. The user specifies the transaction to be added by stating the name, amount, transaction type as well as any other optional fields.
2. The input will be parsed by `AddCommandTransactionParser`, and if it is invalid, `ParserException` is thrown, prompting for the user to enter again.
3. If the input is valid, a `Transaction` object is created and passed into the `AddTransactionCommand` to be executed by the `LogicManager`.
4. The `LogicManager` will then invoke the execute command, adding the `Transaction` to the UniCash.

Note that only the `Category` field is allowed to be specified multiple times, while the other fields can only be specified once, else
a `ParserException` is thrown. Another noteworthy point is that `Category` that are added are to be case-insensitively unique and can only be up to
a specified value in the `UniqueCategoryList` class. Else, a `ParserException` would be thrown.

#### Get Total Expenditure

##### Overview

The `get_total_expenditure` command returns the total expenditure across a given month among all `expense` transactions in UniCa$h, with an optional filter for a given category.

The activity diagram of getting the total expenditure is as shown below

<img src="images/unicash/GetTotalExpenditureActivityDiagram.png" width="1026" />

The following sequence diagram shows how the different components of UniCash interact with each other

<img src="images/unicash/GetTotalExpenditureSequenceDiagram.png" width="1955" />

The above sequence diagram omits details on the creation of the arguments of a `GetTotalExpenditureCommand` such as
`Category` as it would make the diagram cluttered and difficult to read without adding additional value. It also omits
the specific `predicate` behavior of provided to perform the filtering.

ℹ️ **Note:** The lifeline for `GetTotalExpenditureCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a 
limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

##### Details

1. The user specifies the month to retrieve the total expenditure and the optional category 
2. The input will be parsed by `GetTotalExpenditureCommandParser`, and if it is invalid, `ParserException` is thrown,
   prompting for the user to enter again.
3. If the input is valid, a `GetTotalExpenditureCommand` object is created to be executed by the `LogicManager`.
4. The `LogicManager` will then invoke the `execute` method of the command, filtering the existing transaction list to only include `expense` type transactions that fall in the given month and category (if any).
5. The `GetTotalExpenditureCommand` also calculates the total expenditure from this filtered list of transactions.

Note that the month to search is one-indexed, so it ranges from `[1, 12]`. The category is a single filter that is matched in a case-sensitive manner.

#### Delete Transaction

##### Overview

The `DeleteCommand` function deletes an existing `Transaction` from `TransactionList` in UniCash.

The activity diagram of deleting a Transaction is as shown below

<img src="images/unicash/DeleteTransactionActivityDiagram.png" width="600" />

The following sequence diagram shows the interaction between different components of UniCash.

<img src="images/unicash/DeleteTransactionSequenceDiagram.png" width="1200" />

The above sequence diagram omits details on the filtering of `TransactionList` and assumes that
the displayed `TransactionList` is showing all transactions. However, the logic of the `DeleteCommand`
remains the same for all list deletion.

ℹ️ **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteTransactionCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML,
the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

##### Details

1. The user specifies the transaction to be deleted by stating the integer index of the transaction to be deleted.
2. The input will be parsed by `DeleteTransactionCommandParser` and if the provided input is invalid, `ParseException` will be thrown,
and the user is prompted to enter the command again with the correct input.
3. If the input is valid, an `Index` object is created with the given input integer, and passed into `DeleteTransactionCommand` to be executed
by `LogicManager`
4. `LogicManger` will invoke the `execute` method of `DeleteTransactionCommand` which will delete the `Transaction` from UniCash.

It is important to take note that when the user input is parsed, it is based on the currently displayed `TransactionList` inside
`TransactionListPanel`. This means that even if a `TransactionList` contains `10` transactions, given a specific nominally valid
number like `7`, it can still throw a `ParseException` if the shown `TransactionList` contains less than `7` items. This feature is
intentional, as the User is able to, for example, `find` a particular group of transaction and immediately delete those transactions
by just looking at their displayed index number without having to refer to an external identifier of that transaction. UniCash will
automatically handle the visual ordering and representation of transactions with the `TransactionsListPanel` in the UI. The details
and diagrams for this part will be elaborated further in the UI section (and other relevant sections) of this Developer Guide.

#### Edit Transaction

##### Overview

The `edit_transaction` command edits an existing `Transaction` from the `TransactionList` in UniCa$h.

The following sequence diagram shows how the different components of UniCa$h interact with each other. It is further explained in the **Details** section below.

<img src="images/unicash/EditTransactionSequenceDiagram.png" width="1200" />


##### Details

1. The user specifies the transaction to be edited by first stating the (one-based) index of the transaction they want to edit. This
   is followed by listing the fields and updated values that they would like to edit.
   (E.g. `edit_transaction 1 n/Food Clique c/food`)
2. The user input with the requested edits will be parsed by `EditCommandTransactionParser`, and if it is invalid, `ParserException` is thrown, prompting for the user to enter again. It is important to note that at this point, a valid index is any integer that is 1 or greater.
3. If the input is valid, the `EditCommandTransactionParser` creates an `EditTransactionDescriptor` object, which contains the edits which the user wishes to make to the transaction.
4. An `EditTransactionCommand` is constructed with the one-based index of the transaction to edit and the `EditTransactionDescriptor` object. This `EditTransactionCommand` is then returned by the `EditCommandTransactionParser`
5. The `LogicManager` will then invoke the execute command of the `EditTransactionCommand`, editing the `Transaction` in UniCa$h.
6. The `EditTransactionCommand#execute` method then first checks if the one-based index is too large (i.e. if there are only `n` transactions, but the index provided is greater than `n`). If this is true, then a `CommandException` is thrown,
   prompting the user to input an index that is at most, the number of transactions available. If the `CommandException` is not thrown at the step above, then the execution proceeds.
7. The `EditTransactionCommand#execute` method then calls the `createEditedTransaction` method, which creates a new `Transaction` object with the updated values after editing. Note that this `Transaction` object is a different object from what is stored in UniCa$h.
8. The `EditTransactionCommand#execute` method then updates UniCa$h with the new `Transaction` using the `Model#setTransaction` method.

Note that although all fields can be edited, the `Name`, `Amount`, and `Type` fields cannot be left blank. The constraints laid
out in the **Add Transaction** section above also remain.

### Feature Group 2 - Budget Management and Monitoring

### Feature Group 3 - General Utility Features

This includes commands such as Clear, Reset, Help and Exit.

#### Clear Transactions

##### Overview

The `ClearTransactionsCommand` deletes all existing `Transactions` from `TransactionList` in UniCash.

The activity diagram of clearing all transactions is as shown below

<img src="images/unicash/ClearTransactionsActivityDiagram.png" width="400" />

The following sequence diagram shows the interaction between different components of UniCash.

<img src="images/unicash/ClearTransactionsSequenceDiagram.png" width="800" />

**Note:** Given that `ClearTransactionsCommand` takes in no arguments, it does not have an associated Parser class
like the other `Command` classes. This is currently the case, however, given that the command entirely erases the
existing Unicash, a `ClearTransactionsCommandParser` is proposed to be implemented at a later date to ensure an
additional layer of safety for the User.

##### Details

1. The user inputs the command to reset unicash
2. A `ClearTransactionsCommand` object is created with no arguments.
3. `LogicManager` will invoke the `execute` method of `ClearTransactionsCommand` 
which will replace the existing `Model` property with a new `UniCash` object which 
would contain an empty `TransactionList`.

Here, it must be noted that unlike `DeleteTransactionCommand`, individual transactions in the `TransactionList`
are not deleted singularly. As opposed to iteratively deleting each transaction in the `TransactionList`, the more
efficient way to achieve the same effect would be to simply set the `Model` contained in `LogicManager` to an new 
`UniCash` object, as the newly created `UniCash` object would now have an empty `TransactionList` encapsulated within.
This emulates the iterative deletion of all transactions in the `TransactionList`.

### Feature Group 4 - User Interface Features

UniCa$h is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application, built using JavaFX. The following section describes the
implementation of the various UI components in UniCa$h.

#### UI Components
UniCa$sh consists of the following UI components:
1. Main Window
2. Help Window
3. Statistics / Budget Window

<img src="images/unicash/UiClassDiagram.png" width="404" />

In this section, we will be going through the implementation of the main window.

#### 1a. Main Window Design
The main window consists of three components: the command input box, as well as two panes,
the transaction list pane and the command results pane.

For the command input box, we have a custom `CommandBox` class that extends `TextField` to provide
the user with the ability to type their commands into the application.

For the transaction list pane, we have a custom `TransactionListPanel` class that is a `ListView` to
provide the user with a scrollable list of transactions. This view is updated whenever the user executes
commands that modify the transaction list. (i.e. `add`, `delete`, `edit`, `clear`)

For the command results pane, we have a custom `ResultDisplay` class. This pane displays the results of the
user's command execution. This view is updated whenever the user executes commands that modify the transaction.
Error messages are also displayed here, such as when the user enters an invalid command.

#### 1b. Main Window Implementation
The main window for UniCa$h is implemented using the `MainWindow` class. This class is made up of:
1. `CommandBox`: The command input box
2. `TransactionListPanel`: The transaction list pane
3. `ResultDisplay`: The command results pane

All these components, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which provides
the basic functionality of a UI component, such as the ability to set the root node of the component.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework to render the UI components. The layout of these parts are defined
in the matching .fxml files that are located in `src/main/resources/view` folder. (e.g. The layout of the 
TransactionCard is specified in`TransactionCard.fxml`)

The `UI` component is also responsible for:
- executing commands using the `Logic` component, through the `executeCommand` method
- listening for changes to the `Model` component, through the `listenToModelChanges` method

## Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous integration consists of the following:

1. General unit testing
2. UI testing
3. Automated testing on push & pull request on Github
4. Code coverage reporting

### Github Actions Primer

Before diving into the various CI components, it would be good to cover some fundamental concepts about [Github Actions.](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)

Github Actions is used to execute a set of behavior on a repository.

Github Actions are created as YAML configuration files found in the `.github/workflows` folder.

For UniCa$h, Github Actions are broken down into the following components:

1. Trigger: dictates when the action is run
2. Strategy & matrix: specifies the platform (OS) and any relevant versions to run the steps
3. Steps: consists of individual steps that can use other Github Actions to perform a set of actions in sequential order

### General unit testing

General unit tests cover any non-UI related aspect of UniCa$h such as models, commands, and utility.

General unit testing is achieved using [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/) with a combination of several custom built
assertion methods like `CommandTestUtil#assertCommandSuccess` to improve the quality of life when testing.

### UI testing

UI testing provides a way for us to automate some manual tests by simulating button clicks and user inputs
into the UI to assert that the UI responds appropriately.

UI testing is achieved using [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/) and [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX).

To initialize a test class to work with TestFX, annotate it with the following:

```java

@ExtendWith(ApplicationExtension.class)
public class HelpWindowUiTest {
```

This leverages [JUnit 5's built-in extensions system](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#extensions) to
inject an `FxRobot` argument in each unit test. This `FxRobot` instance is used as a driver to perform UI operations on
the running UI, such as performing clicks, entering text, and performing keyboard inputs, along with searching for UI
elements by `fx:id`.

```java
@Test
public void userInput_help_showHelpWindowAsRoot(FxRobot robot)throws TimeoutException{
    var beforeHelpContainer=robot.lookup("#helpMessageContainer").tryQuery();
    assertTrue(beforeHelpContainer.isEmpty());
    robot.clickOn("#commandBoxPlaceholder");
    robot.write("help");
    robot.press(KeyCode.ENTER);
    var afterHelp=robot.lookup("#helpMessageContainer").tryQuery();
    assertTrue(afterHelp.isPresent());
}
```

There are two methods of initializing UI tests with TestFX.

#### Using `@Start`

When defining a `@Start` method, a `Stage` is injected through
the [test runner](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-dependency-injection) and this
allows you to initialize a new `Stage` with custom UI components.

This is especially useful when working with individual UI components like `HelpWindow` and `TransactionCard` as it
provides a medium to render these elements without running the entire UI.

```java
@Start
public void start(Stage stage) {
    helpWindow=new HelpWindow(stage);
    stage.show();
}
```

The `@Start` method is run before each test case.

#### Using `@BeforeEach`

When performing a general set of integration tests across the entire UI (like simulating user input to execution to
view the resulting UI changes), it is best to define a `@BeforeEach` method instead that uses `FxToolkit` to setup
the application (in this case, `MainApp`) with any given setup parameters like default storage location.

It is important to note that if testing the entire application, a temporary storage file should be defined and
provided for `MainApp` to avoid directly modifying the save data on your local machine.

```java
@TempDir
Path tempDir;

@BeforeEach
public void runAppToTests() throws TimeoutException {
    FxToolkit.registerPrimaryStage();
    FxToolkit.setupApplication(()->new MainApp(tempDir.resolve("ui_data.json")));
    FxToolkit.showStage();
    WaitForAsyncUtils.waitForFxEvents(20);
}
```

The `@BeforeEach` method is run before each test case.

It is also good convention to include a `@AfterEach` method to clean up the stages created during `@BeforeEach` so
that all resources are freed after every unit test:

```java
@AfterEach
public void stopApp() throws TimeoutException{
    FxToolkit.cleanupStages();
}
```

### Automated testing on push & pull request on Github

Automated testing is achieved via the `.github/workflows/unit_test.yml` action.

Automated testing is triggered on every push and pull request and is run across all three major OSes: Ubuntu, MacOS, and Windows, and comprise of the following steps:

<img src="images/unicash/ci/AutomatedTestingActivityDiagram.png" width="368" />

UI tests are only run on Windows as both Linux and MacOS requires headless UI testing which is not well supported with Github Actions.

### Code coverage reporting

Code coverage is generated using Github Actions and Gradle and uploaded to [Codecov.](https://app.codecov.io/gh/AY2324S1-CS2103-T16-3)

Code coverage includes both general unit tests and UI tests, and reporting is achieved through the `.github/workflows/gradle.yml` action.

Similar to automated testing, code coverage reporting is triggered on every push and pull request and is run across all three major OSes.

<img src="images/unicash/ci/CodeCoverageReportingActivityDiagram.png" width="368" />

To ensure that code coverage reporting includes both general unit tests and UI tests, the following changes have been made to `build.gradle`:

1. A new Gradle task `uiTest` was created to only run UI tests that end with `UiTest`
2. The default `test` task is configured to exclude such files
3. The `jacocoTestReport` task is modified to only depend on (i.e. run before) the `uiTest` task is the system's OS is not MacOS, Ubuntu or *nux (i.e. Windows only).
4. The `coverage` task includes every `*.exec` file generated from both `uiTest` and `test` so that both coverage reports are available to Codecov

These changes aim to work around the limitation of needing a headless environment in Github Actions as only Windows is able to perform UI tests on Github Action's runners.

The Github action for reporting the code coverage only uploads the coverage reports to Codecov if the runner is Windows as that is when there is a complete code coverage report.

By introducing UI testing into the code coverage reporting, we have been able to achieve a code coverage of > 90%!

## 5. Features & Implementation

This section aims to describe the implementation of the features in UniCa$h.

There are 4 main groups of features that we have designed and either implemented
or propose to implement in the future.

These are:
1. Transaction Management Features
2. Budget Management and Monitoring Features
3. General Utility Features
4. User Interface Features

### 5.1. Transaction Management Features

#### 5.1.1 Transaction Model

<img src="images/unicash/TransactionClassDiagram.png" width="700" />

UniCa$h tracks transactions with the use of `TransactionList` and `Transaction`. `TransactionList` acts
as a wrapper for a list of `Transaction` that enforces no `null`. `TransactionList` does not enforce any equality
constraints, thus any forms of duplicated `Transaction` are allowed to be stored. This was an intentional decision, 
as we want to allow users to record recurring transactions.

The `Transaction` class is composed of the following fields

1. `Name`: The name of the transaction.
2. `Type`: The transaction type of the transaction. UniCash supports expense and income only.
   1. `TransactionType`: An enum comprising of the values `income` and `expense`.
3. `Amount`: The monetary value of the transaction.
4. `DateTime`: The date and time of the transaction to be recorded.
5. `Location`: The location where the transaction took place.
6. `UniqueCategoryList`: A list of categories to be tagged with the transaction.
   1. `Category`: The name of a category tagged to a transaction.

The following are some noteworthy points regarding the attributes
1. There are 3 compulsory fields, namely `Name`, `Type` and `Amount`. The remaining fields would fall back to a default value if not specified.
2. There is a character limit for `Name` and `Location` set at up to 500 characters.
3. `Amount` entered has to be positive for both `income` and `expense`.
4. `Amount` is automatically rounded to 2 decimal places.
5. `UniqueCategoryList` enforces a unique constraint on `Category` it stores.
6. `UniqueCategoryList` enforces a max size of 5 `Category`
6. There is a character limit for `Category` set at up to 15 characters/

#### 5.1.2 Add Transaction

##### Overview

The `add_transaction` command adds a new `Transaction` to the `TransactionList` in UniCash.

The activity diagram of adding a Transaction is as shown below

<img src="images/unicash/AddTransactionActivityDiagram.png" width="500" />

The following sequence diagram shows how the different components of UniCash interact with each other

<img src="images/unicash/AddTransactionSequenceDiagram.png" width="2000" />

The above sequence diagram omits details on the creation of the attributes of a `Transaction` such as
`Name`, `Type` and `Amount` as it would make the diagram cluttered and difficult to read without adding
additional value.

ℹ️ **Note:** The lifeline for `AddTransactionCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML,
the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

##### Details

1. The user specifies the transaction to be added by stating the name, amount, transaction type as well as any other optional fields.
2. The input will be parsed by `AddCommandTransactionParser`, and if it is invalid, `ParserException` is thrown, prompting for the user to enter again.
3. If the input is valid, a `Transaction` object is created and passed into the `AddTransactionCommand` to be executed by the `LogicManager`.
4. The `LogicManager` will then invoke the execute command, adding the `Transaction` to UniCash.

Note that only the `Category` field is allowed to be specified multiple times, while the other fields can only be specified once, else
a `ParserException` is thrown. Another noteworthy point is that `Category` that are added are to be case-insensitively unique and can only be up to
a specified value of 5 in the `UniqueCategoryList` class. Else, a `ParserException` would be thrown.



#### 5.1.3. Delete Transaction

#### 5.1.4. Edit Transaction

#### 5.1.5. etc

### 5.2. Budget Management Features

#### 5.2.1 Budget Model

<img src="images/unicash/BudgetClassDiagram.png" width="250" />

UniCa$h tracks a user's budget with the use of `Budget`.

The `Budget` class is composed of the following fields

1. `Amount`: The name of the transaction.
2. `Interval`: The budget interval of the transaction. UniCash supports expense and income only.
   1. `BudgetInterval`: An enum consiting of the values `daily`, `weekly` and `monthly`.

The following are some noteworthy points regarding the attributes
1. `Amount` here follows the same constraints as the one mentioned in the `Transaction`'s `Amount` class.

## 6. Requirements

Some project requirements under the scope of CS2103

### 6.1. Product Scope

### 6.2. User Stories

### 6.3. Use Cases
The following documents use cases for our application

For the following Use Cases (unless specified otherwise):
- The System is `UniCa$h`
- The Actor is `User`

#### 6.3.1 Use Case: UC01 - Adding a transaction

**MSS:**
1. User enters the command to add a transaction with the correct format.
2. User submits the request.
3. UniCa$h adds the transaction to the transactions list and displays success message.

   Use Case ends

**Extensions**
- 2a. User enters an incorrect format
    - 2a1. UniCa$h displays an error message with the correct command format.
    - Use case resumes at step 1.
- 2b. User enters an extremely high number
    - 2b1. UniCa$h prompts the user with a warning of the input
    - 2b2. User confirms the request
    - Use case resumes at step 3.

### 6.4. Non-Functional Requirements

**1. Portability:** The application should be cross-platform functional on major operating
systems (Windows, MacOS and Linux) running at least Java 11.

**2. Data Persistence:** All data and commands performed by the user should be saved and
backed up locally and be restored upon starting of a new session by the user.

**3. Error Handling:** Implement system logging that is hidden from users to log errors and
issues without inconveniencing the user.

**4. User Documentation:** The User Guide should be clear and straightforward so that the
user can perform all major tasks intuitively.

**5. Maintainability:** Document all non-private methods of the features implemented to
ensure that the code is easy to maintain.

**6. Usability and User Experience:** Ensure the application has an intuitive interface
with easy navigation and clear instructions.

**7. Testability:** Ensure the application meets target test coverage of 85% with comprehensive
test cases.

**8. Performance:** A user should not experience excessive sluggishness while using the
application.

**9. Consistency:** The application should be serve the latest updates of the expense or
income when viewing the information once these changes are confirmed.

**10. Offline:** The application should not require an active Internet connection to function

**11. Performance:** The plots made should be able to be generated for 1000 expenses without
any excessive sluggishness.
